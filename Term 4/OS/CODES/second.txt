Process is a program in Execution.
Process life cycle include two cycles: CPU Cycles and I/o Cycles.
Process to be executed with CPU waits in ready queue.
In order to improve CPU utilization, various schemes are rendered, in the order in 
which process are allotted to the CPU.
FCFS algorithm works on the principle of First Come First Serve.Process is a program in Execution.
